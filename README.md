### 👨🏻‍💻 About Me

Hey, I’m **Reza Pourdast** — a self-taught **Web Developer** who loves turning ideas into clean, functional apps.  
I’m currently studying **Computer Software Engineering** at **Azad University**,  
and constantly improving through personal projects, curiosity, and a bit of obsession with doing things right.

💡 I love the mix of creativity and logic in programming — making things that not only work, but *feel good* to use.  
🦀 Recently exploring **Rust** and low-level development, just to challenge my comfort zone.  
🏋️‍♂️ Outside of coding, I’m passionate about **fitness** and **self-growth** — building both body and mind one day at a time.  
🚀 My goal: to create tools and experiences that actually help people — and to keep learning endlessly along the way.

### 🧩 Fun Facts

- 🎮 Used to be a streamer when I was 15 — learned a lot about creativity and communication.  
- 🍳 I can spend hours perfecting one tiny detail (yes, I’m a bit of a perfectionist).  
- 💪 Lost over **5 kg** in 2 weeks through gym and discipline — consistency is everything.
